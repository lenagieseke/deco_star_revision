\section*{Biographies of the Authors}

\paragraph*{Lena Gieseke} is professor of Visual Media Technologies and Technical Direction at Film University Babelsberg Konrad Wolf in Potsdam, Germany. Her current research areas are media design and artist-friendly HCI. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Stuttgart, working on procedural image representations. Before returning to academia, she worked for several years as artist and developer in the visual effects and 3D computer animation industry.

\paragraph*{Paul Asente} is a Senior Principal Scientist with Adobe Research. His main research areas are 2D design, HCI, and Augmented Reality. He received his A.B. in mathematics from Dartmouth College in 1979 and his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 1987. In the distant past he was a major contributor to the X Window System and has contributed to many Adobe products including Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, and Character Animator.

\paragraph*{Radom\'{\i}r M\v{e}ch}  received his Ph.D. from University of Calgary in Canada, working on procedural modeling of plants and trees. {Radom\'{\i}r} now heads the Procedural Imaging Group at Adobe Research. The group's research covers areas of 2D and 3D design, inverse modeling, and HCI. His areas of research are modeling and imaging algorithms, with a particular focus on user interaction with procedural models, and ease of modeling in general.

\paragraph*{Bedrich Benes} is George McNelly professor of Technology and professor of Computer Science at Purdue University. His research area is in procedural and inverse procedural modeling and simulation of natural phenomena, and he has published over 150 research papers in the field.


\paragraph*{Martin Fuchs}  holds a Ph.D. from Saarland University (2008) for his research on image-space relighting techniques at the Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics. His postdoctoral research took place at Princeton University, where he worked on appearance fabrication and began his work on unconventional light field imaging methods. During his junior professor phase at the University of Stuttgart (2011 - 2016), his research interests extended beyond computational photography to encompass procedural texturing and ornamentation. Since 2016, he is professor for the computer science of Interactive Systems / Games at Hochschule der Medien, Stuttgart, where he became co-director of the Institute for Games.

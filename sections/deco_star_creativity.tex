\section{Means For Enabling Creativity}\label{sec:creativ_means}

Many content generation tasks in computer graphics involve creative considerations. Considering creativity is especially relevant for investigating control mechanisms because the controls provide the means for creative creation. However, creativity is ill-defined and involves insights from various disciplines, making it a notoriously difficult topic to address.

On the one hand, there are efforts to develop algorithms that perform creatively themselves. On the other hand, there is the goal of supporting human creativity with digital tools, which is the focus of this survey. Enabling human creativity is an established field in the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, based largely on the pioneering work of \citeauthor*{shneiderman_2007_cst}~\cite{shneiderman_2007_cst} about \textit{Creativity Support Tools}. This topic has recently found renewed attention~\cite{frich_2018_tyo, frich_2019_mtl, remy_2020_ecs}, asking for more rigorous evaluation in regard to claimed creativity support. Among other aspects,~\citeauthor*{frich_2018_tyo}~\cite{frich_2018_tyo} ask for ``clearer definitions of creativity.'' This shows that the HCI community already strives for the type of survey this STAR proposes. However, for this survey, rooted in the field of computer graphics, we review potentially relevant characteristics of underlying algorithms that enable artists to be creative. We include interface design aspects but they are not the focus of this survey. However, the need to bridge between developing the core algorithms and the interface in order to support creative and artistic intent has been voiced by past research~\cite{deterding_2017_mci,isenberg_2016_inw, salesin_2002_nar}, and this work contributes to this effort.

\citeauthor*{cherry_2014_qcs}~\cite{cherry_2014_qcs} presented an evaluation technique called the quantifiable \textit{Creativity Support Index} (CSI), which has found its way into the graphics community~\cite{shugrina_2017_ppi}. The index measures how well a tool enables creativity based on a psychometric survey. The development and validation of the measurement dimensions---namely, \textit{exploration}, \textit{expressiveness}, \textit{immersion}, \textit{enjoyment}, \textit{results worth effort}, and \textit{collaboration}---are based on user tests. \citeauthor*{cherry_2014_qcs}~\cite{cherry_2014_qcs} quantified the specific phrases participants used to describe a creative process. However, a clear definition of terms like \textit{exploration} and \textit{expressiveness} is missing and the meaning of a statement such as, ``I was able to be very creative,'' is left open. 

A quantified user study is often not feasible, for example for this survey and for assessing the state of the art. Furthermore, doing so would not always be meaningful because supporting creativity is not a goal for most methods. However, most methods do offer carefully developed control mechanisms. We propose a discussion of how the control mechanisms of each technique, as presented by its authors, enable creativity. Based on the given information, we reflect on the potential for the means for enabling creativity in a meaningful way, even if creative control was not necessarily the authors' intention. 

We derive a working basis of such means for enabling creativity in regard to control mechanisms in the following review of relevant references. Our classification is meant as a step toward understanding the creative control options within the current state of the art. In terms of measurement dimensions, it can be seen as an evaluation on algorithmic level and a subset of the more general and user-study-based classification with the \textit{Creativity Support Index}. 

\subsection{Discussion Basis}\label{subsec:creative_means}

\citeauthor*{weisberg_2006_cui}~\cite{weisberg_2006_cui} states that a creative person ``intentionally produces a novel product'' (p.70) and explicitly decouples a possible value of a product from it being the result of a creative process (p.63). 
\citeauthor*{boden_2010_cat}~\cite{boden_2010_cat} described \textit{novelty} as a surprising product, one that the creator did not directly anticipate (p.30). 


The integration of \textit{intention} in describing a creative process is crucial for the development of meaningful algorithms. Weisberg explains that a painter who accidentally stains a painting---a stain that is later applauded by the art world as an innovative technique---cannot be considered to have achieved a creative result. Hence, algorithms need to enable artists to follow their intentions with transparent and controllable mechanisms. 

Weisberg argues that a creator needs domain-specific knowledge and expertise in order to come up with something novel or surprising. He rejects the common perception of creativity as being an ``unfathomable leap of insight'' and advocates its systematic accessibility. 

Weisberg's argument applied in the context of control mechanisms leads to requiring techniques to enable artists to fully understand the domain they work with. Cause and effect of interactions as well as the overall options to control the output must be transparent and navigable.

However, there also must be a large design space for a creator to explore. 
Such an increase of possible options is a core aspect of many common creativity techniques, such as brainstorming, and must also be used for the development of digital tools~\cite{terry_2004_vea}. Design spaces need to be big but also meaningful and well-framed for the domains they represent. They must provide space to delve into without the danger of getting lost. 
Therefore in a system that offers design options, all options need to make sense, while ``enabling someone to see possibilities they hadn't glimpsed before''~\cite{boden_2010_cat}. For the discovery of unseen results, various stimuli can be given, for example well-designed constraints. 


The target audience is also an influencing factor in enabling creativity. Each skill level requires its own unique type of support~\cite{cherry_2014_qcs}. 
%\citeauthor*{cherry_2014_qcs}~\cite{cherry_2014_qcs} discuss the handling of different user competencies as example for the importance of balancing simplicity and expressiveness. The authors mention that more expressive but also more complex tools score higher on the CSI. 
In the following discussion, this survey does not explicitly investigate the appropriateness of a technique for different skill levels unless it specifically distinguishes itself from a related work, as, for example, in \citeauthor*{benedetti_2014_pba}~\cite{benedetti_2014_pba}. Instead it focuses on the general suitability of a technique to create the design goal with a reasonable training curve for an average artist. Also, for this first investigation, we focus on support for a single artist, but it is worth mentioning that enabling collaborative creative work would be a meaningful aspect to consider in the future.

To sum up the brief review in the context of control mechanisms, we consider the categories \textit{navigation}, \textit{transparency}, \textit{variation} and \textit{stimulation} in the context of control mechanisms. We understand variation as the size of the design space within the context of the technique. For the exploration of different designs we distinguish between the general controllability necessary for navigating a design space (``there are many different roads in the landscape''), and the transparency of that navigation and the understanding of cause and effect when using the tool (``I have the map to the landscape and know how to get from one point to another'').  However, at this point, these categories can be seen as somewhat loose and experimental, aiming toward a better understanding of requirements for creative controls. For these characteristics, there is no clear translation into quantifiable metrics, such as timings or error rates, which are standardized measurements for productivity~\cite{cherry_2014_qcs,shneiderman_2007_cst}.

\noindent\textbf{Navigation}

Navigation describes both whether a creation processes is efficiently manageable and the extent of the controllability.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Interactive:} Refers to the lack of noticeable delays when executing controls and computing results. Lengthy, non-creative configuration requirements are potentially distracting. Hence, a thorough analysis should consider the whole process an artist has to go through to produce a result.
    \item \textit{Number of Controls:} Indicates how flexible and controllable a technique is by counting the number of different controls that can be adjusted for one output. 
    Ideally, this category would refer to the ratio in the possible output of visual features that are relevant to humans to controllable features. This would ensure that the controls cover all necessary features and that they complement each other. However, the identification of generally describable, perceptually relevant visual features is out of the scope of this survey and left to future work.

    \item \textit{Navigation History:} Describes the ability to go back and forth in one's own creation process, such as using an eraser.
\end{itemize}



\noindent\textbf{Transparency}
\label{subsubsec:transparency}

Transparency describes how clear the understanding of cause and effect within the system is.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Control Domain:} Refers to how well controls are mapped to visual features and how well they cover the possible design range of each feature. A high-quality control should not have any overlapping effects with other controls.
    \item \textit{Control Communication:} Describes how well controls (\eg~with a visualization and/or little abstraction) represent their effects on the result. For artist-centered tools this could mean that controls should be visual and directly on the canvas.
\end{itemize}


\noindent\textbf{Variation}\label{subsubsec:variation}

Variation indicates how visually different the results can be.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Size of the Design Space:} This is limited if all results look rather similar to each other and are part of a specific design class. A large design space of one technique allows, for example, combining different texture classes such as stochastic and structural creation.
    \item \textit{Openness of the Design Space:} Refers to the limitlessness of possible designs and that there is no attachment of the technique to a specific design class. An open design space enables an artist to come up with a distinctive individual style. Different artists can create inherently different and unique results with the same tool if it has a open design space.
\end{itemize}

We do understand that a clear definition of the available different design classes is needed. However, these depend solely on the design task. 


\noindent\textbf{Stimulation}
\label{subsubsec:stimulation}

The means of stimulation indicate how well an artist can enter a pleasurable and stimulating workflow.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Immersion:} How natural and enjoyable the usage of a system feels.
    An immersive technique needs navigation to be fluent, controls to be intuitive, and the design space large enough to not to hit its boundaries while using the tool. 
    
    \item \textit{Stimuli:} The support for finding surprising results---for example, with design suggestions or variations of the input. Options to support stimulation are still underrepresented but on the rise with machine learning techniques. A clear definition of this category is not feasible at this point.

\end{itemize}

In summary, for handling the ill-defined topic of creativity, we follow the definition of creativity as intentionally producing a novel and surprising product. We derive the means for enabling creative control from recent research results and relate them to control mechanisms. We hope to further a more objective judging of the ability of a technique to support creativity and a detailed comparison of methods and give an first example for that in the following review of the state of the art.

Various aspects of our discussion guides still leave room for interpretation. Knowledge from other disciplines, for example in regard to the perception of visual features, can contribute with valuable insights. We hope that our work inspires such research towards a quantifiable analysis of creative control.
